Simply open the executable, and fill in your profile URL (e.g.: https://ptcgp-tracker.com/u/5fa9ca5c-75d8-4df2-b697-eb374e47668b) and the URL you want to check, the program scrapes from the HTML and mathces your wanted with their tradable and vice versa. After one use, a .txt file is created with your user ID.
### Contribution
Card database can be found [here](https://github.com/hugoburguete/pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-database/), I merged all .json to one file and changed some syntax for consistency. Feel free to raise any issue.
